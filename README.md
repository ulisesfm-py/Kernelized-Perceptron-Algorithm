# Kernelized Perceptron Algorithm
This project implements the kernelized perceptron algorithm for binary classification, utilizing both linear and RBF kernels.

## Overview
The kernelized perceptron extends the standard perceptron to handle non-linearly separable data by applying kernel functions. It allows the perceptron to operate in a higher-dimensional feature space without explicitly computing the coordinates of the data in that space.

## Features
Implements linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels.
Trains a perceptron model using the kernelized approach.
Visualizes decision boundaries for both kernels.
Calculates and displays classification accuracy on test data.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib

## Data
Place the following data files in a data/ directory:

data/train_perceptron.csv
data/test_perceptron.csv
